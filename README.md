The purpose was to collate all of my most frequently used plotting techniques
using only base R graphics. ggplot2 is great, and base R plotting is great,
too! It doesn't matter which data visualization tool you use to tell the data's
story. It only matters how well it tells the story.

Remember: All data visualization is cool. Plot-shaming is not cool.
